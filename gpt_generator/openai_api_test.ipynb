      "SITUATION ANALYSIS: The ego vehicle (id 11) has been experiencing slight deceleration over the past 4 seconds, but currently shows a small acceleration in its longitudinal speed. It is traveling in its own lane without significant lateral movement. Vehicle 3 is ahead of the ego vehicle, consistently maintaining a higher speed and moving further away. Vehicle 10 is also ahead, but it is slightly slower than the ego vehicle, causing it to move closer to the ego vehicle over time. Vehicle 7 is coming from behind and it is overtaking the ego vehicle to the left.\n",

      "The most critical aspect to consider is vehicle 10, which is on the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving slower, causing the gap between them to close. Vehicle 7, which is overtaking to the left, also needs to be considered, but it seems to have sufficient speed to complete the maneuver without interfering with the ego vehicleâ€™s lane change options.\n",

Vehicle 7's position and speed indicate it is overtaking effectively, creating sufficient space in the left lane for the ego vehicle to move into without further complications.
