Do not use conditionals when explaining the information. Convey uncertainty in a reasonable manner.\n\nInstructions:\n\t- The data that is used as input has a temporal spacing of 1 second. The data that is provided contains the last 5 seconds of history of the ego vehicle.\n    - Additionally, you have information pertaining to the group of vehicles that surround the ego vehicle. A group is defined as the vehicles within a bubble of radius of 50 meters around the ego vehicle at any given instant.\n\t- The coordinate system is as follows:\n\t\t- All positional data is relative to the vehicle marked as ego.\n\t\t- The direction in which a vehicle is driving is represented by the sign of its longitudinal velocity. \n\t\t- A positive value in the x coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is ahead of the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- A negative value in the x coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is behind the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- A positive value in the y coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is on the left of the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- A negative value in the y coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is on the right of the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- Small values in the y coordinate indicate that the vehicle in consideration is on the same lane as the ego vehicle\n\t- Road information:\n\t\t- Vehicles are legally required to drive on the right lane.\n\t\t- The left lane is intended to overtake only.\n\t\t- The middle lane is not always present. When it is, it can be used to overtake slow traffic on the right lane.\n\nAnswer template:\n    - The answer needs to have the following content:\n        - Provide an analysis of the situation. DO NOT list every value of information you have been provided, just provide a qualitative analysis of the situation and use data whenever you need to support your reasoning.\n        - Choose ONE possible action from the list, according to your analysis of the situation and focusing on safety and efficiency.\n        - Provide an explanation of the action you have chosen.

A group is defined as the vehicles within a bubble of radius of 50 meters around the ego vehicle at any given instant.\n\t- The coordinate system is as follows:\n\t\t- All positional data is relative to the vehicle marked as ego.\n\t\t- The direction in which a vehicle is driving is represented by the sign of its longitudinal velocity. \n\t\t- A positive value in the x coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is ahead of the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- A negative value in the x coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is behind the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- A positive value in the y coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is on the left of the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- A negative value in the y coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is on the right of the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- Small values in the y coordinate indicate that the vehicle in consideration is on the same lane as the ego vehicle\n\t- Road information:\n\t\t- Vehicles are legally required to drive on the right lane.\n\t\t- The left lane is intended to overtake only.\n\t\t- The middle lane is not always present. When it is, it can be used to overtake slow traffic on the right lane.\n\nAnswer template:\n    - The answer needs to have the following content:\n        - Provide an analysis of the situation. DO NOT list every value of information you have been provided, just provide a qualitative analysis of the situation and use data whenever you need to support your reasoning.\n        - Choose ONE possible action from the list, according to your analysis of the situation and focusing on safety and efficiency.\n        - Provide an explanation of the action you have chosen. Support your explanation with as much data as needed.\n    - The format of your answer is listed below, and is marked with two symbols:\n\t\t- Symbol \"<<<\" marks the start of the template.\n\t\t- Symbol \">>>\" marks the end of the template.\n        - Symbol _ denotes start and end of explanation of content.\n    - Every time you speak about a vehicle, be sure to include a reference to its ID.\n\n\t- Possible actions:\n\t\t- The ego vehicle can perform the following actions:\n\t\t\t- HOLD_SPEED: the ego vehicle maintains its lane and speed.\n\t\t\t- ACCELERATE: the ego vehicle maintains its lane, and accelerates.\n\t\t\t- DECELERATE: the ego vehicle maintains its lane, and slows down.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_LEFT_HOLD: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the left, maintaining its current speed.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_LEFT_SLOW: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the left, and slows down.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_LEFT_FAST: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the left, and accelerates.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_RIGHT_HOLD: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the right, maintaining its current speed.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_RIGHT_SLOW: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the right, and slows down.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_RIGHT_FAST: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the right, and accelerates.\n\n<<<\nSITUATION ANALYSIS: _Include here your reasoning about the geometrical analysis of the situation, as well as any other information you deem fit_.\nACTION: _From the list of actions stated above, choose ONE and only ONE, whichever you think fits the situation best_.\nEXPLANATION: _Explain why you chose the action in the previous section_.\nJSON:\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": _State here the explicit name of the action_,\n        \"explanation\": _Summarize the explanation here_,\n    }\n]\n>>>\n\n"

A group is defined as the vehicles within a bubble of radius of 50 meters around the ego vehicle at any given instant.\n\t- The coordinate system is as follows:\n\t\t- All positional data is relative to the vehicle marked as ego.\n\t\t- The direction in which a vehicle is driving is represented by the sign of its longitudinal velocity. \n\t\t- A positive value in the x coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is ahead of the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- A negative value in the x coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is behind the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- A positive value in the y coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is on the left of the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- A negative value in the y coordinate means that the vehicle in consideration is on the right of the ego vehicle.\n\t\t- Small values in the y coordinate indicate that the vehicle in consideration is on the same lane as the ego vehicle\n\t- Road information:\n\t\t- Vehicles are legally required to drive on the right lane.\n\t\t- The left lane is intended to overtake only.\n\t\t- The middle lane is not always present. When it is, it can be used to overtake slow traffic on the right lane.\n\nAnswer template:\n    - The answer needs to have the following content:\n        - Provide an analysis of the situation. DO NOT list every value of information you have been provided, just provide a qualitative analysis of the situation and use data whenever you need to support your reasoning.\n        - Choose ONE possible action from the list, according to your analysis of the situation and focusing on safety and efficiency.\n        - Provide an explanation of the action you have chosen. Support your explanation with as much data as needed.\n    - The format of your answer is listed below, and is marked with two symbols:\n\t\t- Symbol \"<<<\" marks the start of the template.\n\t\t- Symbol \">>>\" marks the end of the template.\n        - Symbol _ denotes start and end of explanation of content.\n    - Every time you speak about a vehicle, be sure to include a reference to its ID.\n\n\t- Possible actions:\n\t\t- The ego vehicle can perform the following actions:\n\t\t\t- HOLD_SPEED: the ego vehicle maintains its lane and speed.\n\t\t\t- ACCELERATE: the ego vehicle maintains its lane, and accelerates.\n\t\t\t- DECELERATE: the ego vehicle maintains its lane, and slows down.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_LEFT_HOLD: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the left, maintaining its current speed.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_LEFT_SLOW: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the left, and slows down.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_LEFT_FAST: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the left, and accelerates.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_RIGHT_HOLD: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the right, maintaining its current speed.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_RIGHT_SLOW: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the right, and slows down.\n\t\t\t- SHIFT_RIGHT_FAST: the ego vehicle shifts one lane to the right, and accelerates.\n\n<<<\nSITUATION ANALYSIS: _Include here your reasoning about the geometrical analysis of the situation, as well as any other information you deem fit_.\nACTION: _From the list of actions stated above, choose ONE and only ONE, whichever you think fits the situation best_.\nEXPLANATION: _Explain why you chose the action in the previous section_.\nJSON:\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": _State here the explicit name of the action_,\n        \"explanation\": _Summarize the explanation here_,\n    }\n]\n>>>\n\n"
